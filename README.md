# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FdHerrera
I'm from TucumÃ¡n, Argentina.

I'm a Mid-Level Java Developer, doing some Vue.js now because of the requirements of my project so I'm trying to be a Full-Stack Developer.

Some of the technologies I use everyday in my work are Java, and many of the main Project of Spring, and Vue.js.

Here you'll see all of my personal projects I've been working since I start coding.

Check out my [Linkedin Account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fdherreradev/) to be in touch!
