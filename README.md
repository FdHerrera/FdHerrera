# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FdHerrera
I'm from TucumÃ¡n, Argentina.

As a Mid-Level Java Developer with almost 2 years of experience, I excel in back-end development using Java and Spring.

Neovim lover, you can check my neovim configuration in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/FdHerrera/nvim-config) repo, still working on it, still expanding it to be an IDE just like I want it.

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in microservices and containerization technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, to develop scalable and efficient applications.
I am passionate about programming and continuously strive to learn and improve my skills in the field of software development. 
I am always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies to stay up to date with the latest trends in the industry.
